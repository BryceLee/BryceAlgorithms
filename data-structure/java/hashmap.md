## HashMap
```
    Hash table based implementation of the <tt>Map</tt> interface.  This
implementation provides all of the optional map operations, and permits
<tt>null</tt> values and the <tt>null</tt> key.  (The <tt>HashMap</tt>
class is roughly equivalent to <tt>Hashtable</tt>, except that it is
unsynchronized and permits nulls.)  This class makes no guarantees as to
the order of the map; in particular, it does not guarantee that the order 
will remain constant over time.
